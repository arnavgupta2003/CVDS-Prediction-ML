## 1. Motivation

A timely and correct diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases helps provide a better prognosis and improve the quality of patient care. A diagnosis often involves multiple parameters some of which, the doctors might neglect or whose effects are not yet explored. Machine learning applications can identify complex patterns in the data and give much better, timely and accurate diagnoses.The idea for this topic came up due to the large number of cardiovascular-related mortalities during the COVID pandemic which were often caused due to negligence of subtle signs and symptoms. This prompted us to come up with a machine-learning model for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases.

### 1. Effective Heart disease prediction using machine

leaning techniques This study develops a model to predict cardiovascular diseases and reduce related fatalities. Dif- ferent models like random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MP), and XGBoost (XGB) were em- ployed. Parameters were optimized using GridSearchCV. The research concludes that cross-validated multilayer perceptron outperformed other algorithms, achieving 87.28% accuracy. [\[1\]](#_page0_x317.25_y583.04)

### 2. Cardio-Vascular Disease (CVD) and Metabolic

Associated Fatty Liver Disease This study aims to establish a relationship between (MAFLD) . To identify the MAFLD pa- tients with the highest risk of CVD, this paper uses techniques such as multiple logistic regression and PCA on the dataset.The paper concluded that people showing various symptoms of MAFLD had an increased chance of CVD. MAFLD is closely linked with symptoms like high lipid profile due to metabolic dysfunction, whichismainlycausedduetohigh[cholesterol.\[2\]](#_page0_x317.25_y617.91)

### 3. Blood pres-sure variables and cardiovascular risk:

new findings from advance. This research paper is aimed at finding out the importance of Blood Pressure indices such as Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic Blood Pres- sure (DBP), Pulse Pressure (PP) (defined as (mean(SBP)- mean(DBP)) and Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) defined as (DBP+1(PP)) in predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases in a patient, using well-established ML Models such as Cox proportional hazard regression [models.\[3\]](#_page0_x317.25_y683.80)

### 5. Final Outcome

The model is expected to achieve an accuracy of atleast 80% onthetestdataset. ThisprojectaimstocreateaMachineLearn- ing model with a high accuracy of predicting whether a person has cardiovascular disease or not. The project would use clas- sical machine learning algorithms to find a pattern in the data of patients , thereby developing a model whose data could be easily visualized and improved upon to get much better predic- tions.
